/**
 * Level 2 CDK Abstractions for CodeIQLabs projects
 *
 * These are higher-level constructs that combine multiple L1 abstractions
 * to create complete application patterns and infrastructure blueprints.
 *
 * Examples of future L2 abstractions:
 * - Complete web application stacks (S3 + CloudFront + API Gateway)
 * - Database clusters with monitoring and backup
 * - CI/CD pipeline constructs
 * - Multi-environment deployment patterns
