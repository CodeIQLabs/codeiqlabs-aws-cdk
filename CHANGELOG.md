# @codeiqlabs/aws-cdk

## 1.2.1 - 2025-09-01

### Patch Changes

#### Dependency Alignment and Peer Dependency Fixes

This update resolves dependency conflicts and aligns AWS CDK versions across the CodeIQLabs ecosystem for clean npm installs without legacy peer dependency flags.

**Note**: This changelog reflects the next expected version (1.2.1) based on changeset specification. The actual package.json version remains at 1.2.0 following library repository policy - versions are only incremented for actual code changes, not dependency updates.

#### 🔧 **Dependency Fixes**

##### **AWS CDK Version Alignment**
- **aws-cdk-lib**: Updated from `^2.150.0` to `^2.213.0` to match aws-utils peer dependency
- **aws-cdk**: Updated from `2.123.0` to `^2.213.0` for consistency
- **Peer Dependencies**: Updated `aws-cdk-lib` peer dependency from `2.208.0` to `^2.213.0`

##### **CodeIQLabs Package Alignment**
- **@codeiqlabs/eslint-prettier-config**: Updated from `^1.8.0` to `^1.7.0` to match published version
- **TypeScript ESLint**: Aligned to `^8.39.1` across ecosystem
- **ESLint**: Updated to `^9.33.0` for consistency

#### 🎯 **Benefits**
- ✅ **Clean npm install**: No more `--legacy-peer-deps` flag required
- ✅ **Version consistency**: All AWS CDK packages use compatible versions
- ✅ **Ecosystem alignment**: Consistent dependency versions across CodeIQLabs packages
- ✅ **Workspace compatibility**: Maintains hybrid workspace + semantic versioning strategy

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- fe427bd: feat: implement automated release infrastructure with dual module publishing
  - Added @changesets/cli for automated version management and release notes
  - Implemented dual ESM/CJS publishing with conditional exports for maximum compatibility
  - Added comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows for pull request validation and automated
    releases
  - Integrated Husky pre-commit hooks with lint-staged for automatic code quality enforcement
  - Added comprehensive test suite validating both ESM and CJS module loading
  - Updated package.json with changeset-related scripts and enhanced build process
  - Added TypeScript configurations for dual builds (tsconfig.esm.json, tsconfig.cjs.json)
  - Enhanced documentation with contributing guidelines and release process documentation
  - Configured publishing to GitHub Packages with proper authentication and permissions

  This establishes the same sophisticated centralized code quality infrastructure used in the
  eslint-prettier-config repository, ensuring consistent development workflows and automated quality
  enforcement across all CodeIQLabs packages.

### Patch Changes

- 89ea225: Align CI/CD workflows and tooling with aws-utils patterns
  - Update GitHub Actions workflows to match aws-utils patterns (add push triggers, align job names)
  - Update dependencies to use proper versions instead of file references
    - @codeiqlabs/aws-utils: ^1.6.0 (was file:../codeiqlabs-aws-utils)
    - @codeiqlabs/eslint-prettier-config: ^1.6.0 (was file:../codeiqlabs-eslint-prettier-config)
  - Add optionalDependencies for Rollup platform packages to prevent CI build failures
  - Remove duplicate build step in release.yml workflow
  - Standardize CHANGELOG.md format to match aws-utils structure
  - Ensure consistent CI/CD patterns across all CodeIQLabs repositories

- f7f14e3: fix: configure GitHub Packages authentication for CI/CD workflows
  - Updated dependency reference from local file path to published GitHub Package Manager version
    ^1.4.1
  - Added .npmrc configuration for GitHub Packages registry authentication
  - Updated all GitHub Actions workflows (ci.yml, release.yml) to properly authenticate with GitHub
    Packages during npm install
  - Added NODE_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable to all dependency installation steps
  - Configured registry-url and scope for @codeiqlabs packages in workflow Node.js setup

  This ensures CI/CD pipelines can successfully install the centralized eslint-prettier-config
  package from GitHub Packages rather than relying on local file references.

- 7765310: fix: update eslint-prettier-config to v1.5.0 with modular architecture
  - Updated @codeiqlabs/eslint-prettier-config dependency from ^1.4.1 to ^1.5.0
  - Resolves ESLint 9.x compatibility issues with React plugin dependencies
  - Benefits from new modular configuration architecture with proper separation of concerns
  - Minimal configuration now has zero React dependencies, eliminating dependency conflicts
  - Enhanced TypeScript rules and better error handling for missing dependencies

  This resolves the ERESOLVE dependency conflicts that were preventing npm ci from succeeding.

- 7765310: fix: use custom GH_TOKEN for GitHub Packages authentication
  - Replaced GITHUB_TOKEN with GH_TOKEN secret for all npm package installations
  - The automatic GITHUB_TOKEN has limited permissions and cannot read packages from other
    repositories
  - GH_TOKEN is a custom Personal Access Token with proper read:packages permission
  - Updated all workflow jobs (CI and release) to use the custom token
  - This resolves the persistent 403 Forbidden errors when accessing
    @codeiqlabs/eslint-prettier-config

  The custom GH_TOKEN secret has the necessary permissions: read:packages, write:packages,
  delete:packages, and repo access.
