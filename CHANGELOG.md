# @codeiqlabs/aws-cdk

## 1.3.0 - 2025-01-07

### Minor Changes

#### Library-Provided Stack Pattern Implementation

This major update introduces the Library-Provided Stack Pattern, transforming the aws-cdk package
into a comprehensive library that provides reusable, pre-built stack implementations for common
infrastructure patterns.

**New Library-Provided Stacks**

- **ManagementOrganizationsStack**: Reusable AWS Organizations setup for any management account
- **ManagementIdentityCenterStack**: Reusable AWS Identity Center (SSO) configuration
- **BaseStack + L2 Construct Pattern**: Each stack wraps a single high-level construct with minimal
  business logic

**Declarative Stack Registration System**

- **DeclarativeManagementBaseStage**: Automatic stack creation with dependency resolution
- **ManagementStackRegistration**: Type-safe stack registration interface
- **Enhanced Features**: Conditional creation, dependency injection, comprehensive error handling

**Developer Experience Improvements**

- **Simplified Applications**: Consuming apps become pure orchestration layers (60-70% code
  reduction)
- **Improved Import Paths**: `@codeiqlabs/aws-cdk/stacks` vs `@codeiqlabs/aws-cdk/l1/cdk/stacks`
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper error messages

**Architectural Restructuring**

- **Directory Organization**: Eliminated L1/L2 distinction, introduced logical grouping
  (`src/stacks/`, `src/constructs/`, `src/stages/`, `src/common/`)
- **Code Consolidation**: Single source of truth for stack implementations
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Reduced duplication and clearer boundaries

**Breaking Changes**

- Import paths updated from `l1/cdk/*` to simplified structure
- Removed BaseStage class, consolidated into specific stage classes
- Complete reorganization of internal directory structure

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- fcd004a: # Dependency Alignment and Peer Dependency Fixes

  This update resolves dependency conflicts and aligns AWS CDK versions across the CodeIQLabs
  ecosystem for clean npm installs without legacy peer dependency flags.

  ## **Dependency Fixes**

  ### **AWS CDK Version Alignment**
  - **aws-cdk-lib**: Updated from `^2.150.0` to `^2.213.0` to match aws-utils peer dependency
  - **aws-cdk**: Updated from `2.123.0` to `^2.213.0` for consistency
  - **Peer Dependencies**: Updated `aws-cdk-lib` peer dependency from `2.208.0` to `^2.213.0`

  ### **CodeIQLabs Package Alignment**
  - **@codeiqlabs/eslint-prettier-config**: Updated from `^1.8.0` to `^1.7.0` to match published
    version
  - **TypeScript ESLint**: Aligned to `^8.39.1` across ecosystem
  - **ESLint**: Updated to `^9.33.0` for consistency

  ## **Benefits**
  - **Clean npm install**: No more `--legacy-peer-deps` flag required
  - **Version consistency**: All AWS CDK packages use compatible versions
  - **Ecosystem alignment**: Consistent dependency versions across CodeIQLabs packages
  - **Workspace compatibility**: Maintains hybrid workspace + semantic versioning strategy
  - **Zero vulnerabilities**: Clean dependency tree with no security issues

  ## **Migration Notes**

  ### **For Consuming Packages**
  - Continue using `@codeiqlabs/aws-cdk: ^1.2.0` in your package.json
  - Ensure `aws-cdk-lib: ^2.213.0` is used consistently
  - Run `npm install` (no legacy flags needed)

  ### **Compatibility**
  - **Backward compatible**: No breaking changes to public APIs
  - **Workspace linking**: Continues to work seamlessly in development
  - **CI/CD builds**: Clean dependency resolution in all environments

  **Note**: This changeset documents dependency alignment changes for transparency. Version remains
  at 1.2.0 following library repository policy - versions are only incremented for actual code
  changes, not dependency updates.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- fe427bd: feat: implement automated release infrastructure with dual module publishing
  - Added @changesets/cli for automated version management and release notes
  - Implemented dual ESM/CJS publishing with conditional exports for maximum compatibility
  - Added comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows for pull request validation and automated
    releases
  - Integrated Husky pre-commit hooks with lint-staged for automatic code quality enforcement
  - Added comprehensive test suite validating both ESM and CJS module loading
  - Updated package.json with changeset-related scripts and enhanced build process
  - Added TypeScript configurations for dual builds (tsconfig.esm.json, tsconfig.cjs.json)
  - Enhanced documentation with contributing guidelines and release process documentation
  - Configured publishing to GitHub Packages with proper authentication and permissions

  This establishes the same sophisticated centralized code quality infrastructure used in the
  eslint-prettier-config repository, ensuring consistent development workflows and automated quality
  enforcement across all CodeIQLabs packages.

### Patch Changes

- 89ea225: Align CI/CD workflows and tooling with aws-utils patterns
  - Update GitHub Actions workflows to match aws-utils patterns (add push triggers, align job names)
  - Update dependencies to use proper versions instead of file references
    - @codeiqlabs/aws-utils: ^1.6.0 (was file:../codeiqlabs-aws-utils)
    - @codeiqlabs/eslint-prettier-config: ^1.6.0 (was file:../codeiqlabs-eslint-prettier-config)
  - Add optionalDependencies for Rollup platform packages to prevent CI build failures
  - Remove duplicate build step in release.yml workflow
  - Standardize CHANGELOG.md format to match aws-utils structure
  - Ensure consistent CI/CD patterns across all CodeIQLabs repositories

- f7f14e3: fix: configure GitHub Packages authentication for CI/CD workflows
  - Updated dependency reference from local file path to published GitHub Package Manager version
    ^1.4.1
  - Added .npmrc configuration for GitHub Packages registry authentication
  - Updated all GitHub Actions workflows (ci.yml, release.yml) to properly authenticate with GitHub
    Packages during npm install
  - Added NODE_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable to all dependency installation steps
  - Configured registry-url and scope for @codeiqlabs packages in workflow Node.js setup

  This ensures CI/CD pipelines can successfully install the centralized eslint-prettier-config
  package from GitHub Packages rather than relying on local file references.

- 7765310: fix: update eslint-prettier-config to v1.5.0 with modular architecture
  - Updated @codeiqlabs/eslint-prettier-config dependency from ^1.4.1 to ^1.5.0
  - Resolves ESLint 9.x compatibility issues with React plugin dependencies
  - Benefits from new modular configuration architecture with proper separation of concerns
  - Minimal configuration now has zero React dependencies, eliminating dependency conflicts
  - Enhanced TypeScript rules and better error handling for missing dependencies

  This resolves the ERESOLVE dependency conflicts that were preventing npm ci from succeeding.

- 7765310: fix: use custom GH_TOKEN for GitHub Packages authentication
  - Replaced GITHUB_TOKEN with GH_TOKEN secret for all npm package installations
  - The automatic GITHUB_TOKEN has limited permissions and cannot read packages from other
    repositories
  - GH_TOKEN is a custom Personal Access Token with proper read:packages permission
  - Updated all workflow jobs (CI and release) to use the custom token
  - This resolves the persistent 403 Forbidden errors when accessing
    @codeiqlabs/eslint-prettier-config

  The custom GH_TOKEN secret has the necessary permissions: read:packages, write:packages,
  delete:packages, and repo access.
